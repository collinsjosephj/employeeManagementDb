## Description

Developers frequently need to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are known as content management systems (CMS). This project involves building a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer@8.2.4, and MySQL.
